# Add a "supervisor" group and add the webmaster user to it.
# Updating the [unix_http_server] section of the supervisor configuration file
# to make the supervisor socket file writable by this group eliminates the
# need for the webmaster user to use sudo for supervisorctl commands.
#
# E.g.
# [unix_http_server]
# file=/var/run/supervisor.sock    ; (the path to the socket file)
# chmod=0770                       ; socket file mode (default 0700)
# chown=root:supervisor
