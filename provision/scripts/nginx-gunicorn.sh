# NOTE: The various config files copied and/or linked to as part of provisioning
# nginx and gunicorn are deliberately copied out of the provision/conf directory.
# Symlinks and/or references *could* be made to the repository's own copy of
# these config files, but that allows a "git pull" to make server configuration
# changes. Referencing a copy means the provisioning scripts need to be re-run
# to enact such changes - a deliberate step with expected side-effects.
