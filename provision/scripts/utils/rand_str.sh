# Generate a random string using a Python script to choose random characters
# from a set of letters, numbers and punctuation.
# NOTE: An explicit list of punctuation is provided, rather than using
# string.punctuation, so as to exclude certain character sets:
#  - ["'`]: Quotes are excluded to avoid syntax errors, both in the provisioning
#           scripts and if the result is output to a language file (e.g. Python)
#           as a string.
#  - [&\|]: These characters are excluded as they have special meaning in sed
#           replacement strings. String generated by this script are used in
#           sed replacement strings within the provisioning scripts, so
#           excluding these characters avoids unintended side effects.
#           NOTE: The pipe is the standard sed delimeter used in the
#           provisioning scripts.

# The default version of Python available on an unprovisioned system may vary,
# but there should always be one.
