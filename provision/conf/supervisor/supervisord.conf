; users to be given the supervisor group and avoid needing to use sudo for
; supervisorctl commands.

; setting can list multiple files (separated by whitespace or
; newlines).  It can also contain wildcards.  The filenames are
; interpreted as relative to this file.  Included files *cannot*
; include files themselves.
